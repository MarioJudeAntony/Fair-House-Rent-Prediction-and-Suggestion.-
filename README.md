# Fair-House-Rent-Prediction-and-Suggestion.-
This project aims to assist users in estimating fair rental prices for housing based on various parameters.
By inputting key details such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, seller type, area size, locality, property type, layout, and furnishing, the system generates a predicted rent value. This prediction serves as a baseline for users to ensure they're not overcharged and helps in making informed decisions while searching for accommodation.

Key Features:

Rent Prediction: Utilizes the provided housing parameters to estimate a fair rental price.
Comparison : Allows users to assess similar housing options in nearby areas by specifying the maximum acceptable distance from their original location of interest.
Suggestion Feature: Offers suggestions for available housing options matching the input parameters within the defined proximity to the user's preferred area.

How to Use:

Input the details of the desired housing, including bedrooms, bathrooms, seller type, area, locality, property type, layout, and furnishing.
Obtain the predicted fair rent price as a baseline for negotiation or comparison.
Explore nearby housing options within a specified distance to find comparable choices.
